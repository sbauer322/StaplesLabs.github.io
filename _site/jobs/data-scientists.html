<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>SparX is a small engineering team focused on applying online machine
learning and predictive modeling to eCommerce (impacting a 24 billion
dollar business).</p>

<p>We apply engineering and data science to tough problems such as
dynamic pricing, shipping estimations, personalized emails, and
multi-variate testing.</p>

<p>We are always looking for talent in data-science, engineering and
devops. Bonus points if you can bridge 2 of these together. We love
people with strong fundamentals who can dive deep.</p>

<p>We’re a small team, so you will have an opportunity for a high-impact
role, targeting over 50 million users. You will be working on some of
the bleeding edge problems with the freedom to chose your language,
tools and algorithms. You will have access to all the resources and
data from the second biggest etailer in the world.</p>

<p>But our best perk is our colleagues: a diverse and extremely talented
team of stunning engineers, data-scientists and eCommerce experts.</p>

<p>At Sparx we believe that providing an environment with the freedom to
explore and share is the quickest way to innovate. For instance, we
have invested in developing a powerful experimentation platform that
enables us to quickly try out newer algorithms to learn and innovate
fast. Also a lot of our scientists and engineers actively contribute
to open source projects and regularly present our learnings at
conferences and through articles.</p>

<p>We are located in San Mateo, walking distance from the Cal-Train
station. Come visit or apply online at http://staples-sparx.com.</p>
