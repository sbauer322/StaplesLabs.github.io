<h3 id="personal-offers">Personal Offers</h3>

<p>Boosting sales by sacrificing margins is easy – try it, it just
works. However, that is just a race to the bottom. And so is raising margins
and sacrificing a good portion of your existing sales.</p>

<p>The real art is to somewhat manage to increase sales <em>and</em> margin at
the same time; and this is exactly what our “Personal Offer” product
pulls off.</p>

<p>The core idea is actually quite simple. Imagine that you have a
product – say a notebook – whose cost structure is such that:
- you still make good profits with a 10% discount
- but would go quickly in the red if you were to offer a bigger discount.</p>

<p>One of the traditional approach for increasing sales for a notebook is
to offer a 10% discount to every customer, or at least to a significant
portion of your customer base.</p>

<p>This approach is far from being the most effective. To understand why,
let’s focus on a concrete example. Bob &amp; Alice both want to buy a
notebook and come to your online store. The problem is that Bob is
just in a hurry, and could care less about price, as long as the price
is not completely outrageous. Alice, on the other hand, is a very
savvy shopper, with a lot of time on her hands, and it would take at
least a 20% discount to get her sale.</p>

<p>If you give them both a 10% discount what happens?
- You secure Bob’s sale, but you unnecessarily sacrificed 10% of the
  cost in terms of margin, because he would have bought anyways.
- For Alice, this is even worse. You lose both the sale and the
  margin, because 10% is not enough. Darn!</p>

<p>So what our “Personal Offer” product does is to:
- detect that Bob is <em>not</em> price sensitive, and we do <em>not</em> give him
  any discount
- detect that Alice would buy with a 20% discount, and we secure her
  sale by giving it to her, since we “saved” a 10% discount on Bob.</p>

<p>In this way we just doubled our sales and margins, all at the same
time!</p>

<p>Of course this is easier said than done, because Bob might actually be
price sensitive for specific products, specific times of the day or
year, when shopping from a specific location, when exhibiting
specific browsing patterns, etc. This is where our expertise in data
science and machine learning comes in handy.</p>

<p>“Personal Offer” is already running on staples.com and
demonstrating its capacity to boost sales &amp; margins at the same
time. This is just the start though – we are improving our models every
day.</p>

<h3 id="personal-email">Personal Email</h3>

<p>Another of our products running in production is “Personal Email”. The
idea is also quite simple, but it is a powerful one.</p>

<p>We inject personalized content and offers on marketing and
transactional emails. The personalization takes into account everything
we know about the customer: his online and offline shopping patterns,
browsing history, etc.</p>

<p>There is a twist though. We do not decide on the actual content when
the email is sent. We defer that decision to the last possible moment:
when the customer opens the email.</p>

<p>This approach is challenging in that it forces us to flex our
engineering muscles: we need to be able to run sophisticated machine
learning algorithms in a couple of milliseconds to avoid impacting the
customer experience.</p>

<p>However this approach has also proven to be extremely powerful:
- Recommendations can take into account customer activity up to the
  second before the email was open. This maximizes the relevancy and
  impact of the personalized content.
- Even better, we can plug some adaptive algorithms in the mix that
  can self-adapt in real-time to patterns that would be hard to
  <em>anticipate</em> but that can be <em>discovered</em> in real-time: weather
  episodes, local events and celebrations, etc.</p>

<h3 id="smart-shipping">Smart Shipping</h3>

<p>Another area of expertise for SparX is precise shipping time
computations.</p>

<p>Some websites provide shipping estimations in a broad swath, very generic form:
something like “1 to 4 business days”. This is a shame, because if you
know for a fact that a specific product will arrive the same day for a
specific customer – this is a competitive advantage – and you want to
communicate it!</p>

<p>When you already have a great shipping infrastructure like Staples
does, the great thing about communicating personalized and
highly-accurate shipping times is that it has the potential to drive
sales <em>without</em> impacting margins, the all while enhancing the user
experience (timing is often of essence for our customers). Hard to
pass up!</p>

<p>Our shipping models are based on historical data and can predict both
shipping and handling times with a high degree of accuracy.</p>

<h3 id="experimentation-platform">Experimentation Platform</h3>

<p>We have a strong culture of
<a href="/who-we-are#bias-for-action-results--fact-based-decisions">fact-based decisions</a>. This
means that we measure all our products on a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_testing_in_marketing">multivariate testing</a>
platform, that we designed and built from scratch to match our needs.</p>

<p>continue to improve on the intelligence in this platform whenever you have new findings…</p>

<p>In addition to pure measurement, we also leverage our experimentation
platform for safe and progressive roll-out of our new algorithms and
product feature.</p>

<p>At any point in time, we are conducting a lot of concurrent
experiments, through multiple channels. The key challenge in
this setup is to <em>quickly</em> reach statistical significance, but without
sacrificing significant <em>traffic</em> nor <em>profit</em>. We keep learning every
day as, in real-life, this problem is far from trivial.</p>
