  <h1 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h1>

<p>SparX is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works">skunk works</a>
team in Staples, operating with an exceptional degree of autonomy. We
are tasked to design and engineer the products that will shape
Staples’ future.</p>

<p>This setup provides us with the nimble and flexible environment of our
startup roots, combined with the backing and the scale of the 3rd
largest internet retailer, Staples. We love it!</p>

  <li><a href="#our-values">Our Values</a></li>
  <li><a href="#our-tools">Our Tools</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-vision">Our Vision</h2>

<p>Use data and technology to drive eCommerce to the point where every
business process is optimized, and where every customer experience is
special, personal, “indistinguishable from magic”.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-work">How We Work</h2>

<h3 id="data-science--engineering-excellence">Data Science &amp; Engineering Excellence</h3>

<p>Our expertise is in applying technology, innovative engineering and
state-of-the-art data science to the field of eCommerce with
<a href="/what-we-do">products that can drive both sales and margins</a>. We
leverage these skills and experience to attack challenging problems
such as dynamic pricing, shipping estimations, personalized marketing,
product recommendations, and multi-variate testing to name a few.</p>

<h3 id="actual-products">Actual Products</h3>

<p>SparX is a driver of innovation and change within Staples, but we do
not work in the abstract; we are not a research lab. We design and
build <a href="/what-we-do">actual products</a>, deploy them in production, where
we measure their impact on the business with rigorous testing
methodologies.</p>

<p>This approach provides numerous benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Business buy-in: you do not have to wait 5 years for the business to
understand the potential of a novel idea. You can demonstrate its
value early on, in production, on a portion of the Staples customer
base with rigorous A/B testing. Not only is the solution already
built, but you can quantify its impact on the top and bottom line:
we find it a great way to bypass committees and analysis paralysis!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having an idea is easy. Ironing out all the kinks, executing on it,
overcoming setbacks, making it scale: this is where true talent and
excellence come into play. By deploying our ideas early in
production on actual customers, we get speedy and direct
feedback. This allows us to discover the main challenges early on,
progressively shape the idea to its full potential, and converge
quickly to something that actually works at scale. We love this
opportunity to flex our engineering and execution muscles.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="small-teams">Small Teams</h3>

<p>We strive to maintain an environment where everybody can perform at
his or her best, with maximum engagement and impact.</p>

<p>In our experience, this is not something you can achieve if your teams
grow beyond 10 people, especially if creative work is at play. We are
not alone in this analysis; there is a lot of empirical evidence that
supports this conclusion. For instance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After devoting nearly 50 years to studying team performance, the
late Harvard researcher J. Richard Hackman concluded that four to
six members is the team best size for most tasks, that no work team
should have more than 10 members, and that performance problems and
interpersonal friction increase “exponentially as team size
increases.” – http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7317.html</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For this very reason we architect our software services in “team-size”
pieces, involving no more than 6 people. These services and units of
execution can evolve at different paces, pioneer different
methodologies, make different technical choices, or be deployed at
different rates: they all meet at a well-defined API<sup id="fnref:api"><a href="#fn:api" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and SLA<sup id="fnref:sla"><a href="#fn:sla" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This setup enables us to scale while keeping a level of excellence,
engagement and impact seldom found in the industry.</p>

<p>In the same vein, we keep our management extremely flat, team
interactions are extremely fluid and decisions are made based on facts not
roles.</p>

<h2 id="our-values">Our Values</h2>

<p>At the forefront of SparX’s values are ownership, impact, excellence,
freedom and innovation.</p>

<p>We focus on results, not rules, titles or processes.</p>

<h3 id="ownership--impact">Ownership &amp; Impact</h3>

<p>Our teams roll up their sleeves to get the job done, from start to
finish, with no artificial boundaries. They are egoless, and
plain-spoken. They hold themselves directly accountable for the success
of the overall project.</p>

<p>So if you design a software service, you will also build it, deploy it
to production, administrate its underlying infrastructure, monitor it,
and even get paged if it breaks! This will give you the freedom and
the leverage you need to maximize your impact, and avoid local optima:
you are forced to consider the system <em>end-to-end</em>, and you have
<em>control</em> over it end-to-end too.</p>

<p>Similarly our data-scientists fish for data-sources, clean-up the
data, build and debug models, monitor the models while they are
running in production, and report on their business performance. Some
of our data-scientists can even implement the runtime code to execute
these models in production with a 1ms SLA!</p>

<p>Finally our product people decipher the industry, reverse-engineer
Staples’ business and data flows, build bridges with important
partners, secure top executive commitments, keep projects on
schedule and on track, all while keeping an eye on our business
metrics!</p>

<p>So, at SparX, <em>ownership</em> is not an empty word, we all do care
<em>intensely</em> about accomplishing <em>great</em> work.</p>

<p>The best thing about being a part of a team with that level of
commitment, responsibility and accountability is that it is an
amazing enabler. When everybody is willing to pick up whatever
trash is on the floor, it fosters everyone’s capacity to truly innovate.</p>

<h3 id="bias-for-action-results--fact-based-decisions">Bias for Action, Results &amp; Fact-based Decisions</h3>

<p>Speed matters in business and to get tangible feedback you need to
execute. This is why we have such a strong bias to action, we minimize
meetings and emphasize fast delivery. We release to production
multiple times a week. We quickly start our projects on a small scale,
then grow them progressively to their full potential, learning along
the way.</p>

<p>We also focus on great results, rather than on rules or on
process. As long they can demonstrate great results, each team
gets a lot of freedom in how it operates and in its technical choices.</p>

<p>Being result-oriented also means that we measure what we do, look at
the data, and surrender quickly to evidence when we are wrong. We are
not afraid of making mistakes and changing our course of action, based
on the facts.</p>

<p>Finally, another benefit of basing decisions on facts &amp; data is that
it makes hierarchy and roles completely irrelevant. The most junior
person in the team can win a debate with the head of the Lab.</p>

<h3 id="freedom-to-excel">Freedom to Excel</h3>

<p>We seek excellence in all we do, and work hard in forging an
environment that nurtures it.</p>

<p>The first way you get a unique opportunity to excel is by getting a
chance to work on extremely challenging problems – day in and day
out. For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Modeling customer behavior on an individual basis, to the point
where you can literally predict their action.</li>
  <li>Boosting brand, sales &amp; margin at the same time.</li>
  <li>Shaping customer behavior and current traffic in order to align them
with where Staples’ wants to position itself for the next 10 years.</li>
  <li>Conducting a lot of concurrent experiments at any point in time, and
quickly reaching statistical significance, but without sacrificing
significant traffic or profits.</li>
  <li>Building near real-time machine learning services with a 1ms
SLA[^SLA] – as in 99% of the API requests complete under one
millisecond.</li>
</ul>

<p>These problems cannot be brute-forced; they require creativity,
intelligence, and impeccable execution. Wherever you currently stand,
you <em>will</em> feel challenged, and discover that you can achieve things
you previously thought impossible.</p>

<p>The second way we foster excellence is by providing you with the
freedom you need to learn and experiment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Our small team size means that you do not have to convince 30 people
before you can start experimenting on an idea at a small
scale. Secure buy-in from a few people in your team and run with
it. Not all teams need to go at the same pace or in the same
direction: this is the whole point!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since you know everybody has your back, you can focus on doing your
<em>best</em> as opposed to worrying about trying to look good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are ego-less and silo-less when searching for the best ideas: you
can contribute effectively outside of your specialty or current
assignment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We provide sustainable working hours, so that you can recharge,
learn new things on your own, think about it in the shower, and come
back the next day with your all your curiosity and brainpower.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support rapid, eager and active learning by taking the time to
help our colleagues, by sharing information openly and proactively,
by getting frequent &amp; direct feedback from our peers, by leveraging
pair-programming when appropriate, by taking our role in coaching
other people very seriously, and also with a bias for colocation and
in-person communication.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the last thing that makes SparX is a great place to seek
excellence is <em>inspiration</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We are obsessed with finding, recognizing and recruiting exceptional
talent. This makes SparX a great workplace, with stunning
colleagues, who never fail to inspire you with their skills and
their thrust for excellence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This natural dynamic is further reinforced by our flat structure,
where people lead by example.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="discipline">Discipline</h3>

<p>With great power comes great responsibility. We provide the freedom
to experiment, innovate and excel. But, at the same time, it must come
with a lot of operational rigor and discipline for things to be
sustainable and to avoid harmful outcomes. Especially when you are
experimenting in production, with real dollars!</p>

<ul>
  <li>So the fabric of our team is the capacity to, at the same time:
    <ul>
      <li><em>thrive</em> on freedom</li>
      <li>be <em>worthy</em> of freedom</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We monitor all experiments with rigorous multi-variate testing and
abort them early if necessary: before they become too harmful to the
customer experience or bottom line.</li>
  <li>We automate all the boring processes to minimize the risk for error.</li>
  <li>While we think big, we introduce changes in a controlled and gradual
manner. Be it at the code level, the system level or the product
level.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dive-deep--simplify">Dive Deep &amp; Simplify</h3>

<p>When applying your knowledge to challenging real world problems and
pioneering new solutions, you cannot just stay at the surface, you
cannot just settle for the canned package.</p>

<p>Our teams have the capacity to dive very deep, operate at all levels
while staying connected to the details. This also means that we expect
you to challenge prevailing assumptions when warranted, to see beyond
the symptoms and pinpoint the <em>root</em> causes.</p>

<p>This capacity to dive deep, reformulate conundrums, and focus on
fundamentals is a great way to discover practical solutions to
hard-problems. But we do not stop there. When we are done, we
relentlessly find ways to simplify. It is this quest for getting down
to the essence, and keeping complexity under control, is what keep us
nimble as we expand our scope.</p>

<h3 id="passion">Passion</h3>

<p>SparX is filled with people who <em>love</em> what they do, and care
<em>intensely</em> about the products they design and engineer. This is what
gives us the drive we need, and fuels all our other values.</p>
